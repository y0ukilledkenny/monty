=====
A sort of a global tool for reading and editing data usually related to call data records received from a telecom switch 
either in an offline or online mode. Online mode means it is diameter capable. Moslty this is some rough bits of code put
together for the sake of this tool


attributions:
Some part of code is either based on or inspired for modularity from pyprotosim by ssrepfler, 
a nice POC python based library for manipulating data in diameter, radius and other protocols
